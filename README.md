# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is my solution to the Odin Projects Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

Click on any chip to make your choice and start a round.
There are total 5 rounds in each game.
If you have more points than Computer after 5th round, you win the game else you lose.

I've tried to add some animation to make the game a little bit more interactive.
