# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is my solution to the Odin Projects Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

Currently, the game propmpts the user to type any of the valid selection, then runs and displays game mesaages on console.

If user types wrong selection, it throws an error and cancels the current round and procedes to next round.

The Game runs for 5 rounds and displays player and computer score in the console.
